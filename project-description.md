## Project description and requirements
A simple API service that takes a GitHub repository URL and returns a human-readable summary of the project: 
what it does, what technologies are used, and how it's structured.

### Technical Requirements
* Language: Python 3.10+
* Web framework: FastAPI 
* LLM: Nebius Token Factory API. [TBD: choose the LLM model to use]. API key is configured via the NEBIUS_API_KEY environment variable.
* Endpoint
	* Request 
		* POST /summarize
		* Accepts a GitHub repository URL, fetches the repository contents, and returns a summary generated by an LLM.
		* Request body example:
			{
			  "github_url": "https://github.com/psf/requests"
			}
			github_url is a required field of type string. The url points to a public github repository
	* Response example
	{
	  "summary": "**Requests** is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests...",
	  "technologies": ["Python", "urllib3", "certifi"],
	  "structure": "The project follows a standard Python package layout with the main source code in `src/requests/`, tests in `tests/`, and documentation in `docs/`."
	}
	
	| Field | Type | Description |
	| :------: | :---: | :-----------: |
    | summary | string | A human-readable description of what the project does |
    | technologies | string[] | List of main technologies, languages, and frameworks used |
    | structure | string | Brief description of the project structure |
	
* Error handling: On error, return an appropriate HTTP status code and a descriptive and (when possible) actionable error message. 
	* Error response format	
	{
	  "status": "error",
	  "message": "Description of what went wrong"
	}
	* Error types - a partial list
		* url does not point to a github repo
		* github repo is not public

* Deployment
	* A README file which contains:
		* Step-by-step setup and run instructions (assume a clean machine with Python installed). 
		After following these instructions, the server must start and exposes the POST /summarize endpoint.
		* Which LLM was chosen and why (1–2 sentences is fine)
		* The approach to handling repository contents (what you include, what you skip, and why)
	* Once the server is started, it must be possible to test it like so:
	curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/summarize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"github_url": "https://github.com/psf/requests"}'
